## Introduction

Imagine a world where booking a medical appointment is as easy as ordering your favorite meal onlineâ€”no more endless phone calls, no more waiting. MediLocate revolutionizes how Canadians book medical appointments by offering a simple, intuitive platform accessible anytime, anywhere. 

This project provides two types of logins:
- **Patients**: For booking appointments seamlessly.
- **Medical Staff**: For managing clinic availability and sharing schedules.

MediLocate bridges the gap in healthcare accessibility, offering real-time appointment scheduling, user-friendly navigation, and a streamlined approach to connecting patients and healthcare providers.

## Design Problem

### Problem Definition
Accessing healthcare in Canada often involves long wait times and difficulties in finding available clinics. Studies show:
- Nearly 30% of Canadians report challenges in getting timely healthcare.
- 20% of patients experience delays exceeding a week to see a family doctor.

Our platform addresses these challenges by providing a centralized, user-friendly system for clinic schedules and appointment bookings.

## Conclusion and Future Work

MediLocate successfully addresses healthcare accessibility by offering a streamlined platform for appointment booking. However, it is geographically restricted to the pilot cities and relies heavily on accurate clinic data updates. Future improvements include:
- Expanding to additional cities.
- Incorporating advanced features like automated reminders and real-time data synchronization.
- Ensuring full compliance with privacy regulations such as HIPAA or PIPEDA.
